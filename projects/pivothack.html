            After participating in several hackathons, I started to think about why I can’t host a hackathon by myself. In the final months of high school, my friends and I founded PivotHack, a two-day startup hackathon for youth aged 14–18 in China. The event brought together nearly 100 participants from cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Sichuan, and Shandong, along with hundreds of audience members. PivotHack was supported by leading Chinese venture capital firms and accelerators such as ZhenFund, LanChi Fund, MiraclePlus (formerly Y Combinator China), and SparkLab. Today, PivotHack continues to support young builders in China by helping them host their own hackathons and turn early ideas into real projects, while collaborating with initiatives like the Keystone Hackathon and Spark_init Project.
